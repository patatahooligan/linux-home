" It seems that neovim exhibits slightly different behavior to vim
" regarding colorschemes. If you set a colorscheme, trying to set other
" highlight properties fails. I'm guessing it's some sort of priority
" system. This command essentially sets a hook that sets the highlight
" color everytime you load a colorscheme, and this successfully
" overrides the colorscheme. Since I don't unset the autocmd, it should
" mean that the rulers remain the same color even if a load another
" colorscheme. I haven't really tried the gui color (I don't use one). I
" picked one that is probably close and I'll adjust it if it ever
" becomes relevant.
