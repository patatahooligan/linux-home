" It seems that neovim exhibits slightly different behavior to vim regarding
" colorschemes. If you set a colorscheme, trying to set other highlight
" properties fails. I'm guessing it's some sort of priority system. This
" command essentially sets a hook that sets the highlight color everytime you
" load a colorscheme, and this successfully overrides the colorscheme. Since I
" don't unset the autocmd, it should mean that the rulers remain the same
" color even if a load another colorscheme
