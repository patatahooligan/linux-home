# zsh

This config assumes the following packages:

 - zsh
 - zsh-autosuggestions
 - zsh-completions
 - zsh-syntax-highlighting
 - zsh-theme-powerlevel10k-git

It also requires a patched nerd font. If one is not available, you will
probably want to reconfigure powerlevel10k to not use the glyphs from
the nerd font.
